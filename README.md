# keystone-content
Adds a Content model, routing and views to KeystoneJS.

Routing for all Content is root level so an item of content with the slug `foo` would be available at `/foo`.
This enables you to create blog like content outside the `/blog` routes in Keystone.

### TODO:
1. Homepage routing.
2. Nested content routing.
3. Make it a plugin.
4. Dynamic content model designer a la LocomotiveCMS...?
